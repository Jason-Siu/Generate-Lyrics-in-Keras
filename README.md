# Generate-Lyrics-in-Keras
LSTM in Keras that generates country song lyrics.
The lyrics it generated are in the notebook file.

However, that is only the result of a specific architecture. By changing the hyperparameters aka the learning rate the loss function, the number of hidden layer nodes etc, you can get different results. However, I am satified with these results, and I think it's good enough for an inspiration to create actual lyrics for a song.
